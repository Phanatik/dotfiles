Hey there fellow writers, we the staff at Unterzee have decided to give you a special Christmas present this year, to provide some warmth in this cold winter.

We'd like to invite you to Unterzee, consisting of nearly 60 members. This server is mainly for writers, but people who enjoy reading books/comics/manga, watching movies/TV/Anime or anything else, are welcome here as well. And before you worry, this is a safe space for everyone, where they can share their ideas and even just chill with like minded folk.

We're pretty small but we believe that works in our favour as that allows us to form tighter bonds with those who engage. We've got channels for sharing works, writing advice, recommended books, informational videos, helpful softare, showing off drawings, sharing inspiring art and your great taste in music. We even hold a couple of events, like our flagship, the Writing Workshop, where aspiring writers are given the opportunity to present their work and given immediate feedback. Maybe grab a pair of headphones as we vibe through music sessions, or grab a bowl of popcorn for our movie streams. Still not interested? Maybe the people here can convince you otherwise! Our members are nothing but a joy to be around, you might even find that they've already been through stuff that you're currently experiencing, and are always willing to help you through those dark times. 

So what're you waiting for? You're already at sea, why not steer towards the light and pay the [Unterzee](Insert Invite Link) a visit? We can't wait to see you on the other side!
