1. Writing Workshop
```
Our flagship event!
A meeting where we discuss our works, whether they be original or fanfiction, it does not matter so long as they're our creations.
Attendees are usually divided into two categories: ***Workshopper*** and ***Workshoppee***.

There's no pressure to share your work nor is there to verbally speak, as it's possible to use the accompanying #events-vc to chat.

# Workshoppees
```
The person sharing their work to be critiqued. There's no limit to the amount written so long as there's enough in the piece to be given feedback on.

Head to #workshop-sign-up to reserve a slot as a Workshoppee (not necessary for Workshoppers).

There's a limit of **four Workshoppees per Workshop** which typically are organised to occur weekly so if there are less than four, a walk-in slot will become available. **Walk-in Workshoppees go last in the lineup**.
If more than four sign up, any overflow will be prioritised in the next Workshop.  

The lineup of Workshoppees is decided at least three days before the Workshop is held, the date and time of which is decided based on the lineup's #availability. Workshoppees who are unable to attend due to extenuating circumstances will be prioritised for the following Workshop.

During Workshop, the host will determine the order in which Workshoppees will present their work. Those with less free time are able to present earlier (abuse of this will result in deprioritisation in the lineup).

When presenting pieces, the Workshoppee will share their screen to the other attendees. If this is not possible, then the piece can be handed to the host who will share their screen instead. At this point, one of the other attendees will **read the piece aloud** during which the Workshoppee is not to speak unless to assist with pronunciation.

Once the piece has been read out, feedback will be provided (explained in more detail in the Workshoppers section).

Afterwards, the Workshoppee will have the option to ask the rest of the attendees any questions, whether they be regarding specific sections and/or opinions on characters, for example.

# Workshoppers

The role of the Workshopper is providing feedback to the Workshoppees. 

It is important to remember that the goal is to provide *constructive criticism* so substantiate, substantiate, substantiate.

A common pitfall is providing feedback that alters the piece to be written as if the Workshopper were writing it; this is the exact opposite of what Workshop is intended for.
For example, my writing tends to follow certain rules that I'm strict about such as the disuse of dialogue tags ("said", "asked", etc.) so when providing feedback, I don't use this as a negative criticism as there's nothing specifically negative about using dialogue tags, they're a stylistic choice unless their use negatively impacts the piece (i.e. how it flows).

It is important that Workshoppers separate personal opinions from feedback. Please state beforehand if providing an opinion. This doesn't mean that opinions are less valuable than feedback.

Feedback is given in three phases:
1. Positives first. Workshoppers must share what they liked about the piece first.
2. Negatives. Keep these concise. Grammar and spelling, while important, can be fixed in editing.
3. Questions. This is an opportunity for the Workshoppee to find out whether characters, scenes or plot resonate as they intend.
